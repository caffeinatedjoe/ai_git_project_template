# Template Consistency Updates

## Problem
The repository’s template files and workflow artifacts are not fully aligned, which leads to
inconsistencies (e.g., task frontmatter schema, missing derived artifacts, and placeholder README
content).

## Context
The repo is intended to be a process-driven template with canonical Markdown sources and derived
artifacts that remain in sync.

## Plan
- Update task schema consistency by aligning `.pm/TASK_TEMPLATE.md` with `AGENTS.md`
  (owner values) and updating `.pm/backlog/000-project-setup.md` to match the
  template’s section structure.
- Add tracked placeholders for empty directories (`src/`, `tests/`) using
  `.gitkeep` files so the repo layout matches the documented structure.
- Keep `.pm/backlog/BOARD.md` consistent with task frontmatter and note that it
  is generated by `.pm/tools/gen_board.py`.
- Expand `README.md` to explain the repo’s intent, how to create tasks, generate
  the board, and work through the plan/approval workflow, including guidance on
  removing `.kilocodemodes` outside KiloCode contexts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Task template and existing tasks follow the same schema and section structure.
- [x] Required derived artifacts (e.g., BOARD.md) exist in the expected location.
- [x] README explains how to use the template and workflow.
- [x] Empty source/test directories are tracked in Git.

## Out of Scope
- Implementing actual product features beyond template consistency work.
