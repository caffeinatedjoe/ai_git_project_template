# Development Process

## Core Principles
- Task-driven development
- Plan before execution
- Small, reviewable commits

## Workflow
1. Create or refine task
2. Write plan and commit
3. Execute in small commits
4. Mark task complete

## Failure Handling
If blocked or unclear:
- Update task status to blocked
- Document issue
- Stop work

## Communication
All coordination happens via:
- Markdown files
- Git commits
